 Open\+SPICE is a lightweight, Python-\/native circuit simulator. It is bundled with Py\+Spice. As a result, to use Open\+SPICE, replace any usage of Py\+Spice.\+Spice.\+Ng\+Spice.\+Shared with Py\+Spice.\+Spice.\+Open\+SPICE.\+Shared in your Py\+Spice code. Also, if you call the simulator method in the Circuit class, be sure to provide \char`\"{}\+Open\+SPICE\char`\"{} and not \char`\"{}\+Ng\+Spice\char`\"{} as the simulator argument. Other than that, pretty much all of your Py\+Spice code should work the same.

One last detail\+: Open\+SPICE does NOT support variable timestepping. Thus, be sure to use a sufficiently small timestep value for accurate results.
